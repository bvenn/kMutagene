I am currently finishing my masters degree in the lab of @muehlhaus in the department of @CSB at the Technical University of Kaiserslautern and hope to pursue a PhD degree there soon.

### :mag_right: Academic interests

My main academic interests are:
 - meta analysis of large biological datasets and development of related methods
 - machinelearning as one of the tools for above
 - metadata as an interface between wet and dry labs
 - open science
